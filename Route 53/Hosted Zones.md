# Hosted Zones

A Hosted Zone in Amazon Route 53 is a DNS database that contains records for a specific domain and its subdomains. It acts as an authoritative source for DNS information, ensuring that queries for the domain are resolved correctly. Hosted Zones are globally resilient, meaning they are hosted on multiple DNS servers distributed across AWS's global infrastructure to ensure high availability and reliability.

## Key Characteristics of Hosted Zones

- **DNS Database**: A Hosted Zone stores DNS records such as A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, TXT, and others.

- **Authoritative Source**: It is the definitive source of DNS information for the domain it represents.

- **Global Resilience**: Hosted Zones are replicated across multiple AWS DNS servers globally, ensuring low latency and high availability.

- **Domain Registration Integration**: Hosted Zones can be created automatically when registering a domain through Route 53 or separately for domains registered with other registrars.

## Types of Hosted Zones

Amazon Route 53 supports two types of Hosted Zones: Public Hosted Zones and Private Hosted Zones. Each type serves distinct purposes and is designed for specific use cases.

### Public Hosted Zones

A Public Hosted Zone is a DNS database that is accessible from the public internet. It is used to route traffic to publicly accessible resources, such as websites, APIs, or email servers.

#### Key Features of Public Hosted Zones

- **Public Accessibility**: The DNS records in a Public Hosted Zone are resolvable by anyone on the internet.

- **Name Servers**: Each Public Hosted Zone is hosted on four Route 53 name servers, which are automatically assigned when the zone is created. These name servers are globally distributed and integrated with the global DNS system.

- **Resource Records**: Public Hosted Zones store DNS records that define how traffic is routed for the domain. For example:

  - **A Records**: Map domain names to IPv4 addresses.

  - **AAAA Records**: Map domain names to IPv6 addresses.

  - **MX Records**: Define mail exchange servers for email routing.

  - **NS Records**: Specify the authoritative name servers for the domain.

- **External Domain Integration**: Public Hosted Zones can be used with domains registered outside of Route 53. In such cases, the domain's NS records must be updated to point to the Route 53 name servers assigned to the Hosted Zone.

#### Use Cases for Public Hosted Zones

- Hosting public websites or web applications.
- Managing DNS for publicly accessible APIs.
- Configuring email routing for domains using MX records.

### Private Hosted Zones

A Private Hosted Zone is a DNS database that is accessible only within one or more Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). It is used to route traffic to internal resources, such as databases, application servers, or other services that are not exposed to the public internet.

#### Key Features of Private Hosted Zones

- **VPC Association**: Private Hosted Zones are associated with specific VPCs. Only resources within the associated VPCs can resolve the DNS records in the zone.

- **Internal Accessibility**: The DNS records in a Private Hosted Zone are not accessible from the public internet, making them ideal for internal use cases.

- **Split-View DNS**: Private Hosted Zones support split-view DNS, where the same domain name can resolve to different IP addresses depending on whether the query originates from within the VPC or the public internet. This allows for overlapping public and private DNS configurations.

- **Cross-Account Support**: Private Hosted Zones can be shared across multiple AWS accounts using AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) or programmatically via the AWS CLI or SDKs.

#### Use Cases for Private Hosted Zones

- Managing DNS for internal applications and services.
- Resolving domain names for resources within a VPC, such as databases or microservices.
- Implementing hybrid cloud architectures by integrating on-premises DNS with AWS.

## Advanced Features and Use Cases

### Split-View DNS

Split-view DNS allows the same domain name to resolve to different IP addresses depending on the origin of the DNS query. This is particularly useful for organizations that need to serve different resources to internal and external users.

#### Example Use Case

- **Public DNS**: Resolves example.com to a public IP address for external users accessing a website.
- **Private DNS**: Resolves example.com to a private IP address for internal users accessing an application server within a VPC.

### Cross-Account VPC Associations

Private Hosted Zones can be shared across multiple AWS accounts, enabling centralized DNS management for multi-account environments.

#### Steps to Share a Private Hosted Zone

- **Enable Resource Sharing**: Use AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) to share the Private Hosted Zone with other accounts.
- **Associate VPCs**: The recipient accounts can associate their VPCs with the shared Hosted Zone.
