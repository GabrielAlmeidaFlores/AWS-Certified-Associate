# Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)

The Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) is a software utility designed to facilitate the migration of database schemas from one database management system (DBMS) to another. It is particularly useful for organizations looking to transition from legacy database systems to modern, cloud-based solutions. The tool automates the process of converting database objects, such as tables, views, stored procedures, and functions, from the source DBMS to the target DBMS. This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the SCT, covering its key features, supported databases, conversion process, and best practices.

## Key Features

The Schema Conversion Tool offers a range of features that simplify the database migration process. One of the primary features is its ability to automatically convert database schemas from the source DBMS to the target DBMS. This includes the conversion of data types, constraints, indexes, and other database objects. The tool also provides a detailed assessment report that highlights potential issues and compatibility concerns that may arise during the migration process. This report helps database administrators (DBAs) and developers to address these issues before proceeding with the migration.

Another important feature of the SCT is its support for heterogeneous database migrations. This means that the tool can convert schemas between different types of databases, such as Oracle to PostgreSQL or SQL Server to MySQL. The tool also supports the migration of database code, including stored procedures, functions, and triggers, by automatically converting the syntax and semantics of the code to be compatible with the target DBMS.

The SCT also includes a data migration component that allows for the transfer of data from the source database to the target database. This component ensures that the data is accurately and efficiently migrated, preserving data integrity and minimizing downtime during the migration process.

## Supported Databases

The Schema Conversion Tool supports a wide range of source and target databases. The following table provides an overview of the supported databases:

| Source DBMS | Target DBMS                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| Oracle      | PostgreSQL                   |
| SQL Server  | MySQL                        |
| MySQL       | Amazon Aurora                |
| PostgreSQL  | Amazon Redshift              |
| Sybase      | Google Cloud SQL             |
| IBM DB2     | Microsoft Azure SQL Database |

The tool is continuously updated to support additional databases and versions, ensuring that it remains relevant and useful for a wide range of migration scenarios.

## Conversion Process

The conversion process using the Schema Conversion Tool can be broken down into several key steps:

### Assessment

The first step in the conversion process is the assessment phase. During this phase, the SCT analyzes the source database schema and generates a detailed assessment report. This report includes information on the compatibility of the source schema with the target DBMS, as well as any potential issues that may need to be addressed before the migration can proceed. The assessment report is a critical component of the migration process, as it helps to identify and resolve issues early on, reducing the risk of problems during the actual migration.

### Schema Conversion

Once the assessment phase is complete, the next step is the schema conversion. During this phase, the SCT automatically converts the source database schema to the target DBMS. This includes the conversion of tables, views, indexes, constraints, and other database objects. The tool also converts the data types used in the source schema to their equivalent data types in the target DBMS. In cases where a direct conversion is not possible, the tool provides recommendations for manual intervention.

### Code Conversion

In addition to schema conversion, the SCT also converts database code, such as stored procedures, functions, and triggers. The tool automatically translates the syntax and semantics of the code to be compatible with the target DBMS. However, in some cases, manual adjustments may be required to ensure that the code functions correctly in the new environment.

### Data Migration

The final step in the conversion process is data migration. During this phase, the SCT transfers the data from the source database to the target database. The tool ensures that the data is accurately and efficiently migrated, preserving data integrity and minimizing downtime. The data migration component of the SCT supports both full and incremental data migration, allowing organizations to choose the approach that best suits their needs.

## Best Practices

To ensure a successful database migration using the Schema Conversion Tool, it is important to follow best practices throughout the process. One of the most important best practices is to thoroughly review the assessment report generated by the SCT. This report provides valuable insights into potential issues and compatibility concerns, allowing DBAs and developers to address these issues before proceeding with the migration.

Another best practice is to perform a trial migration before executing the full migration. This allows organizations to test the migration process and identify any issues that may arise. The trial migration should include both schema and data migration, as well as the execution of database code in the target environment.

It is also important to plan for downtime during the migration process. While the SCT is designed to minimize downtime, some level of downtime may be unavoidable, particularly during the data migration phase. Organizations should communicate with stakeholders and plan for this downtime to minimize the impact on business operations.

Finally, it is recommended to monitor the performance of the target database after the migration is complete. This includes monitoring query performance, database responsiveness, and overall system stability. Any performance issues should be addressed promptly to ensure that the new database environment meets the organization's needs.
